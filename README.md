# AndroidDevKit
It's a repository of useful features commonly used on Android.

## Why?
When developing Android, there are many times when you need to refer to your previous projects. <br/>
For example, when using sharedPreferences, I found it in my previous project. <br/>
Maybe, many developers will experience this situation.

So, We provide a useful android utils. (how to use retrofit2, how to use recycler view, etc..)

## How?
We will create one utility at least every two weeks.

Utils used while working on previous projects.
